# Cartographer: Retro-Style Star Navigator

Cartographer is a retro-style star navigation tech demo that simulates a 3D starfield in a command-line interface. This project demonstrates basic 3D rendering techniques and provides an interactive experience for exploring a virtual star system.

## Features

- **3D Starfield Rendering**: Simulates a three-dimensional star field using ASCII characters.
- **Player-Controlled Navigation**: Move through the star field using arrow keys and rotation controls.
- **Star Information**: Displays details about the nearest star, including its name, type, temperature, size, and age.
- **Dynamic Star Generation**: Creates a field of stars with randomly generated properties.
- **Simple 3D Projection**: Implements basic 3D to 2D projection for displaying stars and the player's ship.

## Controls

- **Arrow Keys**: Move the player's ship up, down, left, and right
- **W/S**: Rotate around the X-axis
- **A/D**: Rotate around the Y-axis
- **Q/E**: Rotate around the Z-axis

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- NumPy library

## Installation

1. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.
2. Install the required NumPy library:
   ```
   pip install numpy
   ```
3. Download the `cartographer.py` file.

## Usage

Run the script from the command line:

```
python cartographer.py
```
